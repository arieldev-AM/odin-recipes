    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 ¾ cups flour</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups butter</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded Gruyere cheese, divided</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2/3 cup ice water</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine flour, 1 ¼ cups butter, 1/2 cup Gruyère, and the salt in a food processor; 
        pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses. 
        Combine ice water and vinegar in a small bowl; pour half into the food processor and 
        pulse just until combined. Pour in remaining mixture; pulse until dough comes together, 
        about 8 pulses. Divide dough in half. Shape into two (5x7-inch) rectangles. 
        Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine apple slices, brown sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, apple pie spice, thyme, 
        cayenne (if using), and remaining 1 cup Gruyère in a very large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 10x15-inch rimmed baking 
        sheet with parchment paper, extending parchment 2 inches over long sides of pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a lightly floured surface, roll each pastry portion into a 13x18-inch rectangle; 
        transfer 1 portion to the prepared baking sheet, easing pastry into the corners. 
        Spoon filling over pastry in the baking sheet, spreading evenly. Cut 1-inch strips 
        from remaining portion (if you like, twist strips) and arrange over the filling. 
        Use any scraps to create a border; trim edges, if needed, press edges with fork tines to seal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat egg and 1 tablespoon water together in a small bowl for the egg wash; brush onto top of pastry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 1 to 1 ¼ hours. 
        Sprinkle generously with coarse sugar. Transfer pan to a wire rack; let cool 15 minutes. 
        Use parchment to transfer pie from pan to a cutting board; cut into 16 pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve warm or let cool completely. Serve with ice cream and garnish with cinnamon.
      </li>
    </ol>
